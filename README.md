## üéâ Introduction

**Jupiter GUI (EasyDMFollowers-UI)** is an electron application built for both Windows and MacOS. This application primarily fetches a list of your followers and provides features to send Mass DMs to them.

## üí° Background

The inspiration for this application came from the bounty contest [here](https://github.com/balajis/twitter-export) hosted by [@balajiS](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1272199847324471298?s=08). We built this library to submit our entry to the bounty contest.

## üß± Architecture

![Jupiter Core and UI Architecture](architecture.png?raw=true 'Jupiter Core and UI Architecture')

A decoupled architecture where we have an adapter for a given social media platform (Twitter) and connection to external databases through Sequelize ORM enables us to have flexibility with the DB engine used.

## üíé Features

Jupiter GUI comes packed with the following features:

- Fetch **Followers** from Twitter (75000 followers/15 minutes)
- Create **Segments**(lists) of followers based on filter criteria (Filter followers with >= 5000 followers or >= 200 tweets)
- **Segments** can have multiple `AND` or `OR` based filters
- Create (Mass DM) **Campaigns** on selected segments with ranking by followers count, friends count, tweets and retweets.
- Set weights (Number of messages to be sent in a day) for each Campaign
- Schedule your Campaign to send MassDMs at a specific time everyday
- Pause and Resume Campaigns
- Send test DMs to upto 5 users from the Campaign settings before the Campaign kicks off
- Track statistics like number of DMs sent from the app Dashboard

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

##### Requirements

Twitter API keys with access permission set to 'Read, write and Direct Messages'. You can register for a twitter developer account [here](https://developer.twitter.com/)

1. Clone this repository into your local system
2. Perform `yarn install` in the root directory and in the `app` directory to install `electron` dependencies
3. Run `yarn dev`
